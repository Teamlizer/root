## Learning Approach
We should follow these rules to acquire new skills.

- Strengthen foundation knowledge and skills. Once you got these basic things, you're easily to learn new topic.
	- Algorithms: 
		- Search
			- Binary search tree
			- Linear search
			- Statistic search
			- Random search
			- External memory search (for large dataset)
		- Sort
			- Quick sort, merge sort, radix sort
			- External memory sorts
		- Graph
			- Directed acyclic graph
			- Dijkstra
		- External memory algorithms
		- Algorithm design techniques
			- Divide-and-conquer
			- Greedy Algorithms 
			- Dynamic programming
			- Randomize Algorithms
			- Backtracking Algorithms
	- Data Structures: array, linked list (single, double, circular), stack, queue, priority queue, map, hashmap, concurrent queue, tree (binary, red-black, B-tree, ...), ...
	- Operating System Concepts 
		- Process, Thread, IPC, Event-loop, CPU schedule, critical section (block of code that use mutual variables, only need lock in this codeblock),...
		- Multi-threading problems: race condition, dining philosophers, ...
		- Multi-thread mechanisms: lock, semaphore, mutex, ...
	- Networking

		-  Functional: first-class function, higher-order function, pure function, currying, recursion, ...
	- Software Engineering Concept
		- Refactoring 
		- Design Pattern
		- SOLID
		- Code Quality (Clean Code, Clean Architecture, ...)
- Semi-start with step by step tutorial just to gain overview about framework/language.
- Official-start with book, especially books from creators of language/framework. That's a must. Only follow maximum 3 books concurrently, do not use more books for the same topic. Skimming book index, then pick up primarily book to follow, others play support role.
- At the same time, **kick off own product using that technology**. It's also a must. Use [https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) and [https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning)
- Pursue MOOC course from Coursera/EdX, Udacity or Udemy. Seriously. **Paid course is better** because it constrains us, at least on money.
- Always use official documentation. 
- Must have an own written comparison report with other technologies. So need some tasks to benchmark.
- If it makes you interested in, do actively in community (Facebook group, Telegram chat, Slack chat, Skype chat).
- Tips: spend enough time to give smart questions because **only smart questions deserve full of quality answers**.
